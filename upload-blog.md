#### Mini LibGDX Beginner Game
I've been working on a small demo game using Java's libGDX library a few months ago. After watching a beginner's course to the framework (which uses the barebones of the tools provided), I decided to apply what I learned to a slightly more complex project. The core mechanics of the game are finished, albeit with a few bugs, but I am now working extending it to being more complete. 
The latest implementation of the game now involves an addition of the options menu, with the ability to switch weapons, that have their names and properties now defined. Currently need to test the features, and fix the options buttons to make sure the weapon selection is easier (make the hit area bigger).
