<div id="About" class="tabcontent vert">
<div class="text-container">
<p>I wanted an alternative to Youtube that will allow professionals, creators, and sometimes entertainers to demonstrate 
their work to the audience that could be potential employer or collaborator. It's a collective way of writing 
portfolios.</p>
<p>Usually, these will be in the form of videos but I wanted to add an audio and game library showcase to the mix due to 
the nature of the site.</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsed" >
The Site
</button>
<div class="hiddentext">
<p>"VP", the unofficial name of the site based on the initials of the final version, is a site that allows users to 
upload their works and life experiences. People can show how it was done, they can write a portfolio. It's a platform 
for multiple professions. Wether it's for tech skills, artistic expressions, ideas for debate, or pure entertainment... 
It's a simple place for all the showcases, classified into relevant sections to avoid conflicts with word searches.
If the user wants to keep it on their drive, download is available.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsed">
Users
</button>
<div class="hiddentext">
<p>Users range from video editors, musicians, sound engineers, game developers, and/or tutors.</p>
<p>In addition to videos and live or archived streams, users can also upload music as audio tracks to the site, for 
use as part of other videos or promoting the release of the artists' albums. A price can also be set for downloadables.</p>
<p>Game developers may also want a simple place to have full control of their promotion, so why not provide a library for 
indie and mid-level companies to promote their product and provide information.</p>
<p>Each member has control over their content. Whether they use predefined templates or code the structure entirely 
with their own code, users can set up their portfolio in any way they like. In addition, they can program what they want 
filtered with the Node library.</p>
<p>A user can host multiple channels and present themselves as something different from another, providing all 
these channels a variation of personalities and presentations. Want to make videos but have a separate music channel 
display solely the works? You can do that here.</p>

<h3>The web building</h3>
<p>The first part was to set up the page to make a prototype visible to the viewer. The process took a while especially 
with discovering a new library based on flexbox. The structure has been fixed but the style has still got a few cracks in 
the area. Eventually got what I wanted in order. </p>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>Now it came to navigation events.</p>
<h3>Server Programming</h3>
<p>The server environment was added to generate dymanic pages with templates.</p>
