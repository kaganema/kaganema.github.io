<p>Hello, I am software developer and content creator. I am a graduate in Computer Graphics and 
Games. </p>
<p>This is my webpage that covers tutorials and some code. I tend to keep things private and just use 
this as support. I might get this more views depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Tutorials here are just things I have done, or doing and trying to help others in certain projects. 
Maybe there will be something for you, who knows.</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy these tutorials and see what you make of them.</p>
